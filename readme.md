# Laravel-Angular-Typescript starter project
Full stack starters kit including build and watch tasks for development. Use all modern features from all those cool frameworks. With this project you can start making application with Laravel with Angular and TypeScript.    

## Laravel PHP Framework
[Laravel](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1 is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

## AngularJS (1.4)
[AngularJS ](http://www.angularjs.org/) lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.  It lets you
use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s
syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically
synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches
the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.

## Typescript
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types, classes, and modules to JavaScript. TypeScript supports tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.
